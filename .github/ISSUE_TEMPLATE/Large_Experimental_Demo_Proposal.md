## Project Proposals
- Each subgroup can produce project proposals
- When ready, proposals can be read out at the global monthly meetings
- Different subgroups/teams can contribute to the proposals if it makes sense

**Access to IBM hardware:**
If proposals involve experiments on quantum hardware, we can assess feasibility based on current device time budget. Aggie Branczyk (Agata.Branczyk@ibm.com), will help facilitate hardware support
and enablement.
